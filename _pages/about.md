I'm a second year graduate student from [The Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Linhua Jiang](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~jiang/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography. Before coming to PKU, I got my Bachelor degree at Nanjing University in Sep. 2023.
