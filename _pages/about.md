I'm a second year graduate student from [Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Linhua Jiang](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~jiang/). My main research interests include the multi-wavelength characteristics of AGNs and their host galaxies, the evolution of high-redshift AGNs/galaxies, and machine-learning/data-driven astrophysical research. Before coming to PKU, I got my Bachelor degree at Nanjing University in Sep. 2023.
